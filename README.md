# crawler-classifier
Background Sentiment analysis, which is a powerful technique based on natural language processing, has a wide range of applications, including consumer reviews analysis, recommender system, political campaigning, stock speculation, etc. A sentiment analysis model requires a large text corpus, which consists of classified articles grabbed from the internet using web crawlers. In the simplest scenario, a text corpus can be built by two components: a web crawler and a classifier. The crawler browses through web pages and grabs articles from websites. The grabbed articles are stored in a buffer, from which the classifier processes articles and classifies them. Considering the complexity of modern websites, it usually takes a long time for a crawler to locate and grab an article from the web page. So, the speed of crawlers is usually too slow for the classifier. Thus, multiple crawlers would be a better choice.
